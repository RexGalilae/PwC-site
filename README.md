# Welcome to Program with Conscience (PwC)! 
Program with Conscience (or PwC) will be the site where we will talk about common programming anti-patterns and pet peeves we commonly encounter, having worked on and reviewed code from several projects.

This site aims to be more than just a styleguide, we try to go above and beyond what ESLint will tell you based on pitfalls we've run into ourselves, reviewing and writing code that powers enterprise applications and getting them to production.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Under Construction
This site is still in progress! We've only dumped our content here but we'll soon start organizing it into tagged pages

## Who are we?
We're senior node.js developers who work for a company called PwC (ANY similarity to our website name, living or dead, is PURELY coincidental). Combined, we have 15+ years of experience and have experienced our fair share of horror stories and are here to tell you about it.
